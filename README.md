# ERgency
ERgency is an Android app that allows patients to send their own personal medical records to an emergency provider before they arrive in order to ensure better clinical care in times of emergency. 
When an emergency healthcare situation occurs, our application can quickly be put to use. It will allow users to look for the nearest urgent care and/or emergency department. It will list hours, clinician information, and services provided so the patient can make an informed decision about where to go. 
Once the patient decides on a location, he/she can fill out a quick registration form to let the site know that they will be coming in. This allows the providers to plan ahead and prioritize their patients and resources accordingly. 
The pre-registration form, along w/ the patientâ€™s medical record, will be sent to the site for review and ensure a smoother flow once the patient arrives
